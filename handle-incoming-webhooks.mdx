Once a webhook endpoint is setup and verified, you can start receiving webhooks and will have access to the delivery overview page. Here you can:

- See the delivery status of your webhooks
- Review payload sent
- Trigger redelivery in case of failure

# Validate & Parse webhooks
Use the SDKs [available on GitHub](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks) to validate and parse the webhooks.

# Failure handling

### Delivery Retries
If we hit an error while trying to reach your endpoint, whether it is a temporary network error or a bug, we’ll retry to send the event up to 5 times with an exponential backoff.

### Deliver Timeout
We timeout our requests to your endpoint after 20 seconds. Triggering a retry attempt after a delay as explained above. However, we strongly recommend you optimize your endpoint route to be fast. A best practice is for your webhook handler to queue a background worker task to handle the payload asynchronously.


### Invalid signature exceptions
Rolling your own webhook validation logic? Make sure to base64 encode the secret you configured on Minostack in your code before generating the signature to validate against.
