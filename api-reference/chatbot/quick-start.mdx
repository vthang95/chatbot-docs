## What is a bot?

A bot is a workflow of multiple agents that can be used to automate a variety of tasks.

As you can see in the picture above, a bot can have some resources:
### Knowledge base
A knowledge base is a collection of documents that can be used to answer questions.
A knowledge base can have multiple types of documents such as files, text, web page, etc.

### Conversation stages
The conversation can be customized by adding stages and custom instructions for each scenario.
For example, a conversation can have some stages like "Awareness", "Intent", "Action", etc.
You can add custom instructions for each stage. This make your bot more flexible and customizable.

### Products
If your bot needs to answer questions about products such as product information, pricing, etc, you can add products to your bot.
A product also be used to create orders if the bot target is `order`.


### Media
You can organize media such as images, videos, audios, etc. in a media library so that the bot can send media to the user.
